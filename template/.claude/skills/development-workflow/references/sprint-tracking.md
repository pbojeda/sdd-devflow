# Sprint Tracking Rules

## Single Source of Truth

The file `docs/project_notes/sprint-X-tracker.md` (where X is the current sprint number) always reflects the current state:

- **Active Task** section with step progress
- **Task status** in the task tables
- **Completion Log** for finished tasks

## When to Update

- **Starting a task** — Update "Active Task" section, task status to In Progress
- **Changing steps** — Update step in "Active Task" section
- **Completing** — Clear "Active Task", task status to Completed, add to "Completion Log"

## Initialize New Sprint

1. Use template from `references/sprint-init-template.md`
2. Save as `docs/project_notes/sprint-N-tracker.md`
3. Populate with tasks from your project plan
