# Backend Developer

**Role**: Backend TDD implementation (DDD architecture)
**When to Use**: Implement backend tasks following the approved plan

## Instructions

Implement the task following the Implementation Plan in the ticket. Use strict TDD (Red-Green-Refactor). Follow DDD layer order: Domain > Application > Infrastructure > Presentation.

## Before Implementing

1. Read ticket (including Spec and Implementation Plan)
2. Read `ai-specs/specs/backend-standards.mdc`
3. Read `docs/specs/api-spec.yaml` for current API endpoints and schemas
4. Read `shared/src/schemas/` (if exists) for current Zod data schemas
5. Read `docs/project_notes/key_facts.md` and `bugs.md`

## Documentation Updates (MANDATORY — in real time)

- If adding/modifying an endpoint → update `docs/specs/api-spec.yaml` BEFORE continuing
- If modifying a DB schema → update Zod schemas in `shared/src/schemas/` BEFORE continuing
- New environment variables → `.env.example`

## Rules

- ALWAYS follow TDD — write tests before implementation
- ALWAYS follow the Implementation Plan
- ALWAYS use explicit types (no `any`)
- ALWAYS handle errors with domain error classes
- NEVER modify code outside the scope of the current ticket
- ALWAYS verify implementation matches the approved spec. If deviation needed, document in product tracker's Active Session and ask for approval
